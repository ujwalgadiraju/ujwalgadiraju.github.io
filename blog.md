# WIS Delft at HCOMP 2021 

We are excited to share that WIS Delft will be very well represented at AAAI HCOMP 2021, the premier international conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing. Research contributions from members of WIS Delft resulted in the acceptance of 3 full papers, 2 works-in-progress, 2 demonstrations, and 1 blue sky idea. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the different contributions that will be presented at HCOMP 2021. 

## Full Research Papers

- [A Checklist to Combat Cognitive Biases in Crowdsourcing](https://ujwalgadiraju.com/Publications/HCOMP2021b.pdf): Tim Draws, Alisa Rieger, Oana Inel, Ujwal Gadiraju, Nava Tintarev

Recent research on data quality and the concomitant downstream effects on machine learning models and AI systems has demonstrated that cognitive biases can negatively affect the quality of crowdsourced data. Although this is now well-understood, cognitive biases often go unnoticed. Since significant efforts and costs entail the large-scale collection of human annotations across a plethora of tasks, there is unquestionable value in making such data collections reliable and resuable. To facilitate the reuse of crowdsourced data collections, practitioners can benefit from understanding whether and which cognitive biases may be associated with the data. To this end, task requesters (i.e., those who design and deploy tasks to gather labels or annotations online from a distributed crowd) need to ensure that the task workflows and design choices do not trigger cognitive biases of those who are contributing with their *human input*. Addressing this need in our work led by [Tim](https://timdraws.net), we propose the [**Cognitive Biases in Crowdsourcing Checklist** (CBC Checklist)](https://osf.io/g5b82/) as a practical tool that requesters can use to improve their task designs and appropriately describe potential limitations of collected data. We envsion this checklist to be a living document that can be extended by the community as and when new cognitive biases are discovered or understood to affect human input in crowdsourcing tasks. Collaborating on this work was inspiring for our team and we hope this can benefit the community! We invite you to read the paper to learn more about how the CBC Checklist can be used in practice. The paper also provides further analysis motivating the need for such a tool. 

- [Exploring the Music Perception Skills of Crowd Workers](https://ujwalgadiraju.com/Publications/HCOMP2021c.pdf): Ioannis Petros Samiotis, Sihang Qiu, Christoph Lofi, Jie Yang, Ujwal Gadiraju, Alessandro Bozzon

In this work led by [Petros](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/samiotis), we explored the realm of music content annotation campaigns on paid crowdsourcing platforms. Crowd workers are expected to annotate complicated music artefacts, which can demand certain skills and expertise. Traditional methods of participant selection are not designed to capture these kind of domain-specific skills and expertise, and often domain-specific questions fall under the general demographics category. Despite the popularity of such tasks, there is a general lack of deeper understanding of the distribution of musical properties - especially auditory perception skills - among workers. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a user study (N = 100) on Prolific. We asked workers to indicate their musical sophistication through a questionnaire and assessed their music perception skills through an audio-based skill test. The goal of this work is to better understand the extent to which crowd workers possess higher perceptions skills, beyond their own musical education level and self reported abilities. Our study shows that untrained crowd workers can possess high perception skills on the music elements of melody, tuning, accent and tempo; skills that can be useful in a plethora of annotation tasks in the music domain.
