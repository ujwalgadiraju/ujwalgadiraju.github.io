Ujwal Gadiraju is an Assistant Professor at the [Web Information Systems](http://wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) group of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS/EWI), [*Delft University of Technology*](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). He is a Director of the [Delft AI "Design@Scale" Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ai/design-at-scale-lab), and a member of the program management team of the [TU Delft AI Labs](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ai/tu-delft-ai-labs). In addition, Ujwal co-leads the <a href="kappa">Kappa</a> research line on Crowd Computing and Human-Centered AI at the WIS group. He is a Distinguished Speaker of the ACM, and a board member of [*CHI Netherlands*](https://chinederland.nl). Ujwal is currently serving as the Co-Editor for two Frontiers in AI journals: (1) [Human-Centered AI and Crowd Computing](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/19868/human-centered-ai-crowd-computing) and (2) [User Modeling and Recommendations](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/19653/user-modeling-and-recommendations). He is also an Associate Editor of the Taylor and Francis [Behavior and Information Technology](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tbit20/current) journal and the Co-Editor-in-Chief of the [Human Computation Journal](http://hcjournal.org/). <!--was a Research Fellow at the [Weizenbaum Institute](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en/) -->

Prior to joining the WIS group, Ujwal worked at the [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/en) as a Postdoctoral researcher between 2017-2020. Ujwal received a [PhD degree](http://www.l3s.de/en/node/1537) (Dr. rer. nat.) in Computer Science from the Leibniz University of Hannover, Germany in 2017, and an MSc. Computer Science degree from TU Delft, the Netherlands in 2012. His research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Information Retrieval (IR), with a special focus on Crowd Computing. Ujwal’s prior work in Crowd Computing has explored methods to improve the effectiveness of the crowdsourcing paradigm, running large-scale human-centered experiments to understand the interaction between humans and machines, and understanding the societal impact of algorithmic decision-making.

<!--Ujwal’s work focuses on systematically leveraging the ‘hybrid intelligence’ obtained by combining humans and machines to solve a range of problems in HCI and AI. -->

Ujwal's goal is to **create novel methods, interfaces, systems, and tools to overcome existing challenges on our path towards building better AI systems and facilitating better reliance of humans on AI systems**. 

<!-- To this end, his current research agenda includes the following topics:

 - <a href="adms">Human-AI Interaction, Human-AI Collaboration, and Human Computation</a>
 - <a href="conversational_interfaces">Conversational Agents and Interfaces</a>
 - <a href="kg">Human Factors in Interactive Information Retrieval</a>
