Ujwal Gadiraju is an Assistant Professor at the [Web Information Systems](http://wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) group of the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS/EWI), [*Delft University of Technology*](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). Prior to joining the WIS group, Ujwal worked at the L3S Research Center as a Postdoctoral researcher between 2017-2020. Ujwal received a [PhD degree](http://www.l3s.de/en/node/1537) (Dr. rer. nat.) in Computer Science from the Leibniz University of Hannover in 2017, and an MSc. Computer Science degree from TU Delft in 2012. His research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Information Retrieval (IR), with a special focus on Crowd Computing. Ujwal’s prior work in Crowd Computing has explored methods to improve the effectiveness of the crowdsourcing paradigm, running large-scale human-centered experiments to understand the interaction between humans and machines, and understanding the societal impact of algorithmic decision-making.

In general, Ujwal’s work focuses on systematically leveraging the ‘hybrid intelligence’ obtained by combining humans and machines to solve a range of problems in HCI and IR. His current research agenda pertaining to Crowd Computing and Human-centered AI includes the following topics:

 - Conversational Interfaces for Crowd Computing
 - Impact of Algorithmic Decision-Making on Humans
 - Understanding the Dissonance Between Humans and Machines
 - Characterizing, Measuring and Predicting User Knowledge Gain through Web Search
