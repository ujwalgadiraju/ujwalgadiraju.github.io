Based on our recent work at AAAI HCOMP 2020, we are currently running controlled experiments to train student mentors at TU Delft on essential skills required to better support students facing stress management or anxiety related challenges using a conversational agent called 'Trainbot'.

## DANDELION – A Conversational Crowd Computing Platform

In this project we will develop a crowd computing platform with a conversational interface – a Web-enabled application
that interacts with students and staff members at TU Delft (by means of traditional chat applications like Telegram,
or Microsoft Teams). The aim is to support decision-making processes (e.g. to decide whether to attend a given
event on the campus, or to find out what/where the next lecture is). This involves the satisfaction of an information
need (e.g. information about the crowdedness of the event area, or the timetable of a given student) and solicit data
about a given event (i.e. crowdsensing), or answer information needs from other users. In addition to serving such
use-cases, the project also aims to gather an understanding of student ‘wellbeing’ periodically by leveraging the engaging means of the conversational interface.
