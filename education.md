Machine Learning is increasingly important to fields outside of traditional Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, proving a powerful technique to study data from different domains. This course aims to give students from different technical backgrounds a better understanding of a range of machine learning techniques. During the course, the focus lies on understanding how to use these different techniques, rather than on trying to improve the techniques themselves. To do this, this course will focus on demonstrating how machine learning can be used in different domains and for different types of data. Throughout the course, teachers from different faculties will apply the techniques they teach to their own domain of research to give students experience with a wide range of topics studied at TUDelft. Additionally, the course will address some of the ethical and societal issues around machine learning such as privacy and bias.
